# ESPN4CC4C Environment Configuration
# =========================
# Copy this file to .env and update the values below

# =========================
# MUST UPDATE THESE FIRST
# =========================

# Your timezone (IANA format, e.g., America/New_York, Europe/London)
TZ=America/New_York

# Resolver base URL (must be reachable by Channels DVR)
# Replace YOUR_LAN_IP with the LAN IP of the host running this stack
# IMPORTANT: Use your Docker host's IP, not localhost or 127.0.0.1
# Examples:
#   Windows PC: Use ipconfig to find your IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
#   Linux: Use hostname -I to find your IP (e.g., 192.168.86.72)
VC_RESOLVER_BASE_URL=http://YOUR_LAN_IP:8094

# Chrome Capture integration (use the SAME host IP)
# If using Fire TV automation with Chrome Capture, set these:
CC_HOST=YOUR_LAN_IP
CC_PORT=5589
