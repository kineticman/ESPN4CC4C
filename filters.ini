# ============================================================================
# CREDENTIAL-BASED PRESETS
# ============================================================================
# Choose ONE scenario based on your ESPN access:
#
# SCENARIO 1: ESPN+ Subscription Only (~305 events)
#   - College sports, niche content, UFC PPV
#   - Requires ESPN+ monthly/annual subscription
#   - Uncomment these two lines:
#
# enabled_networks = ESPN+
# require_espn_plus = true

# SCENARIO 2: Linear TV Provider Only (~463 events)
#   - ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPNews, ACC Network, SEC Network, etc.
#   - Requires cable/satellite/YouTube TV/Hulu Live/Sling/etc.
#   - Uncomment these two lines:
#
# exclude_networks = ESPN+
# require_espn_plus = false

# SCENARIO 3: Both ESPN+ AND Linear TV (~768 events, includes simulcast duplicates)
#   - Show everything you can access
#   - Note: Some events (like "The Pat McAfee Show") appear on multiple networks
#   - This is the DEFAULT if you don't uncomment anything:
#
enabled_networks = *
# require_espn_plus is intentionally left unset to allow both

#   require_espn_plus = false     # EXCLUDE ESPN+ content (linear TV only)
#   exclude_ppv = true            # Remove UFC pay-per-view events
#
# NOTE: If you set a SCENARIO above, these may already be configured
# require_espn_plus =
exclude_ppv = true

# ============================================================================
# ADVANCED OPTIONS
# ============================================================================
# Fine-tune filter behavior

# Case-insensitive matching (default: true)
# When true: "nfl" matches "NFL", "Nfl", "nFL", etc.
case_insensitive = true

# Partial league matching (default: true)
# When true: "NCAA" matches "NCAA Football", "NCAAM", "NCAAW", etc.
# Useful for filtering all college sports at once
partial_league_match = true

# ============================================================================
# EXAMPLE FILTER COMBINATIONS
# ============================================================================
# Here are some common filtering scenarios (all commented out by default).
# Uncomment ONE section to use it, or create your own!

# --- Professional Sports Only (No College) ---
# enabled_leagues = NFL,NBA,NHL,MLS,UFC
# enabled_sports = Football,Basketball,Hockey,Soccer,MMA

# --- College Sports Only ---
# enabled_leagues = NCAA
# partial_league_match = true

# --- Football Only (College + Pro) ---
# enabled_sports = Football

# --- Major Networks Only (No Overflow/Regional) ---
# enabled_networks = ESPN,ESPN2,ESPNU,ESPNews
# exclude_networks = ESPN+,ACCNX,SEC Network +

# --- No Talking Heads/Studio Shows ---
# This would require custom title filtering (future feature)
# For now, you can manually exclude specific leagues/sports

# --- Weekend Games Only ---
# This would require day-of-week filtering (future feature)

# ============================================================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING
# ============================================================================
#
# Q: I set filters but nothing changed?
# A: Make sure you ran update_schedule.sh after editing this file
#
# Q: I'm seeing fewer events than expected?
# A: Check the logs in ./logs/plan_builder.jsonl for filter statistics
#    Run: python3 bin/generate_filter_options.py ./data/eplus_vc.sqlite3
#    to see what's currently available
#
# Q: How do I see what filters are active?
# A: Check logs/plan_builder.jsonl or run update_schedule.sh manually
#    Look for lines with "event":"filter_applied"
#
# Q: I want to reset to defaults?
# A: Set all enabled_* to "*" and all exclude_* to empty
#    Or delete this file and regenerate with:
#    python3 bin/generate_filter_options.py ./data/eplus_vc.sqlite3 --generate-config > filters.ini
